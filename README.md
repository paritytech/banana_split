# Banana Split üçå &middot; ![Yarn tests](https://github.com/paritytech/banana_split/workflows/Yarn%20tests/badge.svg) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/paritytech/banana_split](https://badges.gitter.im/paritytech/banana_split.svg)](https://gitter.im/paritytech/banana_split?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Banana Split makes your paper backups more resilient and secure using [Shamir‚Äôs secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

It splits your secret (e.g., paper backup) into `N` pieces, but only requires a majority of those pieces (`N/2+1`) to recover your secret.

## Why Banana Split?
There‚Äôs a few problems with normal paper backups:
If you have the whole paper backup somewhere, you‚Äôre vulnerable to someone finding it and stealing it‚Äîwithout you ever knowing they did (e.g., they can just take a photo of it).
If you split your paper backup into two, what happens if one of those pieces goes missing?

For example:

You use Banana Split to split your paper backup into 5 pieces. You then give 5 friends a piece. It only takes 3 of those friends to come together to retrieve the paper backup. If 2 of your friends end up losing their piece, it‚Äôs okay. And if 2 of your friends collude and try to retrieve your backup, they won‚Äôt be able to.
That is to say:

**Any 3 friends will know everything; any 2 friends will know nothing.**

## Usage
### How do you make a Banana Split?
1. Save the Banana Split [HTML page](https://bs.parity.io/) and **open it in offline mode**.
2. Type your secret into Banana Split.
Your secret will be encrypted with an auto-generated passphrase and split it into the number of QR codes you specify.
3. Print out your QR codes.
4. **Write the passphrase by hand on every sheet**.
Doing this by hand protects against an attacker intercepting things you‚Äôre sending to the printer.

### How do you retrieve a Banana Split?
Recovery can be done on any device with a webcam.

1. Save the Banana Split [HTML page](https://bs.parity.io/) and **open it in offline mode**.
2. Using your webcam, scan in a majority of your QR code printouts (e.g., if you had 7 printouts, you‚Äôll need 4).
3. Enter your passphrase.
4. Viola! Your secret is restored.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
###  Work local and offline

Banana Split is a self-contained HTML page.
To ensure your precious data is never sent outside, it only works when opened from your local hard drive while your browser is in Offline mode.

### Without the passphrase, you won‚Äôt be able to retrieve your secret

To retrieve your secret, you‚Äôll need to have a majority of the printouts and know the passphrase.
This is why it is critical for you to write the passphrase on every printout.
